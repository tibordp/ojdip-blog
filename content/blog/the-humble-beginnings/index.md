After quite a long time of hesitation and indecisiveness, I have finally managed to get it together and start a blog. Despite having been active in the IT field for quite a while, I have never set up a place where I could unconstrainedly express myself, i.e. personal webpage, mostly for the reason that I have never really had anything to say to the masses. (well, I've been writing a Windows Longhorn beta testing blog for a while, but let's just agree to never mention it again, shall we? ☺)

Well, things have changed. I have become more proactive in my fields of interest and during my technological meanderings, I have stumbled upon some interesting problems, figured out some interesting solutions and it would be a waste if I kept it all to myself and a small circle of my colleagues. I think that becoming active in the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) community helped towards this decision the most, because I have developed a habit of regular written expression, of whatever sort it may be. Hence, during my summer internship at Arnes, the idea of this blog was born _et voilà_, here it is. To the more fundamentalist of you: Yes, it is powered by WordPress and no, I am not ashamed. I find it quite exquisite thus far.

The content on this blog will probably revolve around topics that interest me most. Generally, you should expect some networking (routing software/hardware, IPv6 deployment and developments, ...), some programming (C++11, alogrithms), and almost certainly some mathematics and linguistics. Occasionally I will (probably) drop in some non-technology, Real Life™ stuff. Maybe.

I guess that a promise that I will be posting regularly is in place but I consider this a bad omen. I hope it works out ☺.
